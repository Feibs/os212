## Tips 📌
These are just some personal tips from personal experience studying in Operating System 2021-2022 Class.
Feel free to follow if you find it wise 😁

### 1. Study from last year's exam
This is helpful to understand what we actually learn in this course and to answer the weekly quiz. So stay tune for the synchronous class as the exercise walkthrough is demonstrated there with no recording.

### 2. Use [explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/) to browse bash command
This website is essential to comprehend what the command does. You can just type the command there and read the explanation by its corresponding parts.
_note: hop to [my links page](LINKS/) for other resources_

### 3. Read each post from our lecturer on SCELE thoroughly and frequently
Don't miss weekly contact on forum, don't miss your name on attention forum, don't miss anything from forum :)

### 4. Notice that assignments, forums, and quiz will be parsed to be graded
Follow the writing instructions.

```Djangan bersoesah hati :") U caaaaannn!```
