### 1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8) 🎬  
📍 It feels right to put this video on the top of the list since this is the first video about Operating System that I've watched before becoming a CS student. This introduction video of Operating System will take you to an adventurous time travel to the past!  
📍 Back in the day, executing program was done manually. Programmers wrote their codes on punch card, carried it to a room-sized computer, then handed it to computer operators to input the codes to computer. Therefore, the invention of OS came as the solution to automatically operate computer by batches.  
📍 OS became intermediate between softwares and peripheral hardwares, so programmers didn't have to write codes for every model of peripheral devices. Specifically, OS provided the device drivers.  
📍 OS also made it possible for many programs to be processed at the same time on a single CPU. To accomodate multitasking, memory allocation should be organized. With Virtual Memory, all programs assumed the memory started at address 0, so programs wouldn't be scattered all over the memory. Meanwhile, the physical location in memory was hidden and abstracted by OS. This enabled dynamic memory allocation and memory protection. _Atlas_ was the first computer and OS to support those features.  
📍 Thanks to dedicated research for inventing and developing OS, now we have that awesome OS running in our pc and mobile phone which allows us to do multitasking, thus making our life easier and happier!  
Let's dive more into it in upcoming weeks ✨
